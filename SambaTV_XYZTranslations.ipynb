    "The French XYZ site translation has a higher conversion rate for users from France (~8%) compared to those in French-speaking countries outside France (~5%). Since the only translation was from a French speaker from France, this could be an issue of localization. French dialects differ from country to country, so it is possible that French speakers not native to France are not connecting with the French translation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test this hypothesis, localizations were provided for a number of French-speaking locales around the world. Each country in the test had the site translated by a native of that country. The test was run from November 30 to December 4, 2015. Users in that time were split randomly into a test and control group. The test group were shown these new localized translations, while those in the control group were shown the old translation by the native of France. \n",
    "\n",
    "The preliminary results of this test are surprising: the control group has a higher conversion rate. At face value, this would imply the localized translation are having the opposite effect as anticipated. Further analysis shows this not to be the case, however. The discrepancy is a result of both lower overall conversion rates in Algeria and Mauritius and a higher proportion of users in test group in those countries. After excising Algeria and Mauritius, the conversion rate is the same for the control and test group, showing the localized translations have no effect."
